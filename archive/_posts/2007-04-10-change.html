I wonder sometimes about how <span style="font-style: italic;">real </span>my faith is. Do I truly believe the things that I claim to? Or are they just grand, epic ideas that have some sort of romantic, classical appeal? <span style="font-style: italic;">Ideas are interesting. Beliefs are life-changing.</span> Is my life changed? Better yet, has my life changed for the better?<br /><br />Someone once told me that the best part in life is change. That though change is difficult, it is the vehicle for improvement. And thats what we fundamentally want, isn't it? A better life. A better job. Better relationships. Better friendships. <span style="font-style: italic;">If we all want better things, why are we so against change?</span><br /><br />In the moments of life that we finally let go, that we finally die to ourselves, that we finally understand that we dont understand... It is in these moments that grace like rain can fall down on us. It is in the valleys of life that we can clearly see the beauty of the mountain. And yet it is at the highest peak of the mountain that we can see the richness of life in the valley. Change is the path in between, the path that allows us to move into a position to see the grand splendor of life, and to recognize truly how great this life really is.
