My son,  <p>Your namesake is one of independent action, intentional living, and transformative thinking. My prayer is that you would be a man that is kind hearted, who wants to help others, and can lead them to be better.  <p>Leadership is something that is the birthright of every man. God created you to lead your household, just like Jesus leads the church. It is not something you can shirk away from, and so my hope is that you will willingly step into that role, deliberately and intentionally.  <p>There are many books on leadership out there, but over the years, I've been able to boil those thoughts down into 5 key learnings.  <blockquote> <p>Leaders <em>motivate</em> those they lead to action by providing a compelling mission and vision. <br>Leaders have the <em>tenacity </em>to drive outcomes and to overcome adversity and resistence.<br>Leaders <em>build relationships</em> that create trust and promote honesty.<br>Leaders are <em>stewards</em> of even the least of those that they lead.<br>Leaders <em>leave no one behind</em>. </p></blockquote> <p>I'm sure there are many other nuggets of wisdom that you will pick up over the years, but these are just a few that I've found to be timeless truths. I hope they can serve you well, as they have done so for me. </p>
