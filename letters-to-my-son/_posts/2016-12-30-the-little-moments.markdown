My son,

As you will have discovered by now, I love the epic, the grand, the vast and expansive. Naturally this means that I spend a lot of time thinking about it, and have spent a number of my notes to you espousing my thoughts on that. 

Today's thought will be quite contrary, but at least as important if not moreso. 

> It is the little moments in life that that *really* make us feel human.

It's the accumulation of the little things, the seemingly insignificant instances whose individual presence may not account to much but whose combined impact is far greater than the sum of its parts. They may be as small as a friendly wave from an acquaintance, a kind word from a stranger, or a shared experience with a friend. 

While the big moments are the ones that stand out, it's the continual flow of little moments that forms the backdrop for those epic events to be seen. 

As you know, I love photography, and a very basic understanding in photography is that no matter how beautiful your subject is, your photo is only as good as the background elements - the light, the backdrop, the scene, the underlying notes of color and contrast - all these things bring *life* to the subject. 

It's these little things that ultimately determine our character and overall composition. And amazingly enough, it's these little things that we often have the most control over. 

So my challenge to you today is to impact the little things in your life as best you can. Be the one that gives a friendly wave. Speak an encouraging word. Give a stranger a smile. Give a friend a hug. 

While it's difficult to orchestrate an epic moment, the little ones are absolutely within our realm of control, so I urge you to take the opportunity to help make positive little moments for those you interact with, and to be a bright spot in someone's day.

There's a book on your bookshelf right now that your mom and I read to you that has us imagine people with buckets. Each act of kindness fills someone's bucket a little bit at a time. Such a simple yet beautiful analogy that even at a young age you were able to understand. So I'll leave you with the sentiment of that book: go and be the best bucket filler you can be!
