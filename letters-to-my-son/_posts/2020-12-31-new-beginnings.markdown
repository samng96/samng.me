My sons,

Something I've always valued is retrospection and introspection. Looking back at our experiences to learn from them, and looking within to thoughtfully consider the choices, decisions, and actions we've taken are two very good habits to build. As with any habit, it's best to start building them early and when one doesn't *need* them yet. Taking a page from Robert Redford in Spy Game:

> "When did Noah build the ark, Gladys?"<br>
> "<pause>"<br>
> "Before the rain."

Looking back on this year, it has definitely been one for the history books with all the unexpected twists and turns. It's been a trying year for most, full of challenges, upset routines, and new and very real fears. It's brought folks face to face with many insecurities: meaning, purpose, relationship, isolation. It has caused many to look forward, to desire a different future, and to even take action towards making that different future happen.

As we think through those new beginnings, I want us to consider a few important things.

#### The future is decided by optimists
I'm not just being optimistic here myself, hoping for a future that is defined by optimists. The future will *always* be decided by optimists.

Why? Because it's human nature to desire inspiration, to follow those that are inspiring. We are wired to *move life forward*, to strive for a tomorrow that's better than today. Optimists paint those pictures, tell those stories, and dream of those grand and epic scenarios.

We aren't attracted to pessimists. We may resonate with their negativity, and we may seem to connect over a shared disdain, fear, or dislike, but ultimately they don't attract or inspire us in the long run. It's the optimists that attract us, and ultimately it will be the optimists that change the world for the better and decide what our future looks like.

#### Be FOR other people
Coming out of this isolating time, I would challenge us all to be more *for* other people. We've already had enough focus on ourselves this year. Let us make tomorrow more about other people than ourselves. Let us make it a time where we think more of others, do more for others, care more for others, and love others more.

#### It's never too late to start
Lastly, it's never too late to start making the changes you want to see in yourself! If I've learned anything at all this year, it is that it's never to late to get started.

You may have had a rocky start. You may have rough soil to work with. You may have spent years down a path that you're not happy about. But that's okay. We move life forward, one step at a time. Tomorrow isn't defined by what you did yesterday; it's defined by what you set your mind to do tomorrow. So as we start this new beginning, my challenge to you both is to start it by being optimistic that the best is yet to come, and by setting your minds on being for other people.

Happy new year!
