<p>My son, <p>By now, I hope you know how much I love the <em>epic</em>. I love experiencing things that make you think of things as they <em>ought to be</em>, that make you want to be different, that make you strive for more. <p>The danger though, is that in trying to emulate the characteristics that we experience and read about, we may overstep that boundary and try to be like the characters themselves instead of emulating their characteristics. It's a subtle difference, but it's there nonetheless, and if unchecked, can lead you places you may not have initially intended to go. <p>My challenge to you as you grow up and experience all these rich and wondrous experiences, characters, and stories, is to <em>always be a first-rate version of yourself, instead of a second-rate version of someone else</em>. Know who you are, who you want to be, who you were <em>purposed</em> to be, and use <em>that</em> as your measure. Don't compare yourself with others; rather, be inspired by their example to strive for more yourself. <p>The world will try to pit you against others, will try to compare you on a variety of axes and scales, will even try to tell you that your worth is relative to others. Don't listen to them.  <p>The Bible tells us that we are <em>wonderfully</em> made (Psalm 139:14), and that God knew us before He formed us (Jeremiah 1:5). That applies to you! You are our perfect little boy, and your mom and I love you and will always love you, no matter what you choose to do and who you choose to be. <p>My prayer is that no matter what kind of person you grow up to be, no matter what experiences you have, what pursuits you take, and what company you choose to keep, that you <em>intentionally</em> choose all of those things, and that you be the best <em>you</em> that you can be!</p>
