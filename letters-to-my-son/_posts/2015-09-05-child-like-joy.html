My son,  <p>As your second birthday approaches, I've been thinking about&nbsp; what a wonderful little guy you've become and about all the fun that we've had together, and one thing that has definitely stood out is just how happy you are.  <p>From the moment you wake up, you're a happy, smiley, mischievous little guy. You love to play, and spend much of your life running away from me while laughing hysterically, only to run too fast, fall over, roll around on the ground, and keep laughing. Your infectious laugh can be heard all through the house at all hours of day, whether we're eating, playing basketball, banging the drums, or trying to get you to bed.  <p>It's been a fantastic reminder to me of what it means to have child-like joy, and how incredibly easy it is to become jaded by the world, to lose the ability and desire to laugh and to have fun in many circumstances.  <p>Why is this important? All sorts of reasons. But a few of them stand out to me as extremely important.  <ol> <li>Laughter helps diffuse even the tensest situations. Jesus says that<em> "in this life, you will have trouble".</em> It's not a matter of if we run into emotionally charged situations, but a question of when we encounter them. Laughter helps alleviate these situations and lets us be at our best to handle them.</li> <li>Joy is contagious. Not only does it lighten up your own life, but it catches others with it as well. It is a part of the equation of leadership - people are drawn to joyous people, to charismatic people, to people who have something that they want to emulate in their own lives. And everyone wants to be joyful and happy.</li> <li>Laughter helps us be in a mental and emotional state where we can be our best. The paragon of man is not realized when he is angry, stressed, or upset; rather, it is realized when he is of good spirit, of good cheer, and of a happy and joyful countenance. </li></ol> <p>As you know by now, I'm someone who loves to think of the world not as it is, but as it <em>ought</em> to be, and I'm positively convinced that the world was designed to be a place that's happy, joyful, and full of great adventures and experiences.  <p>As life gets busier (and it always will), let's try to remember to find a little laughter in what we're going through. My hope for you is that you won't lose that sense of wonder, that ability to find fun and levity in the most grave of situations, and that you'll always continue to be our happy little guy.</p>
