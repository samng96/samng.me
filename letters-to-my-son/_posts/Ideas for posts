- How can you achieve your 10 year plan in the next 6 months? - Peter Thiel
- A great leader seeks to understand more than they instruct, debate more than they direct, push people to decide rather than decide themselves, pursuade rather than give orders.
- Being a leader is a role or a job, not a value judgment!
- Information - insight - revelation - assimilation

- Don't have a big life dream - they focus you only on one thing and you miss the things around you
- Dignity is the mastery of the external whereas redemption is the mastery of the internal.

- Composure
- Nonviolent communication
- Ubiquitous connectivity of the future

- Trust boils down to four things - integrity, intent, capability, results.
- What are you willing to risk to get what you want?

- If the dream is big enough, the facts don't matter
- Self worth - identity tied to achievement, or inherited by God?
- Mythos, CS Lewis
- Leading is not when you want to fight something. It's when you say you can beat it instead of fighting it. (?)
- Disruption happens when there are people that want to disrupt and when an industry has lost the will to lead

- Build great habits

- Promptness is a sign of respect
- There is no "them"
- List well - ask "is there more"?
- Excellence in Stewardship - Joseph/Potiphar and Daniel/Darius

- And yet we also live in a time of the 10 second sound byte, the 50 word tweet, the 2 minute read, and the TL;DR. So much information is flooding our senses in an attempt to capture the most valuable currency the internet has to offer; our eyeballs. Our attention. Our views. Our likes.
- The quest for nobility of character seems like it’s no longer there, and has been replaced by the quest for what? Instagram fame? Success? Career advancement?
- Fierce independence is a trauma response

- Personal humility - always point to factors other than themselves. About their people, competitors stumble, etc. At the same time, people around them all point to them.
- Corporate ambition - ruthless and relentless when it comes to lifting up the organization to do more.

- Transcend the argumentative immediate and think higher and aim higher
- And one people
- “The role of senior leader was no longer that of controlling puppet master, but rather that of an empathetic crafter of culture”
