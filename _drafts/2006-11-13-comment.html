When I was younger, I used to love getting words of encouragement given to me. Granted, when you're young, words of encouragement and words of praise seem indistinguishable, although now that I'm all old and wise, I still often cant tell the difference. They've probably got some studies that'll back me up on this (I hope), but I'm pretty sure that children need to be encouraged. From an early age, the level of encouragement, nurture, and care that a child receives drastically influences their developmental outcome. Parents and teachers alike bend over backwards to tell the kid how awesome they are, how beautiful and smart they are and all that. And it works. Apparently.<br /><br />They've got studies that show how children that were encouraged and praised grew up to be well rounded, emotionally stable adults, while children raised in homes where the praise was scarce grew up to be unstable, unreliable adults, often with some sort of emotional difficiency (trust issues, low self esteem and self image etc). So the conclusion is clear and obvious - encourage children.<br /><br />But why does it stop there? Why does it seem like when a certain age hits, the encouragement tap just gets shut off? I spent the last year working for one of what I'd say is the best bosses around. Why was he awesome? Not cause he was a sharp guy who knew how to manage well and knew the ropes of the business, but because he knew how to encourage people. He knew how to make them feel like they could take on the world. And from what I'm told, thats rare in a manager these days...<br /><br />I'm beginning to be convinced that encouragement is a completely different and foreign language than what is regularly spoken around these parts. Its a language that most people know how to speak, and that everyone has the ability to learn to speak, but its still one thats not spoken nearly enough.<br /><br />I believe that one of the greatest of God's gifts is the ability to encourage each other, to spur one another on towards the goal. With a few simple, small words, we can drastically change a life.
