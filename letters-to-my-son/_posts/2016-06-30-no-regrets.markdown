My son,

Life's too short to live with regrets. While it is certainly good to go back and consider where you've come, do so to learn from the experience and not to regret what's happened. Everything is 20/20 in hindsight - use that to your advantage. Go back and consider the things that have happened, but do so *in order to learn from the experience*, not to regret what's happened.

I love the concept and the thought of the *epic moment*. I love how it transcends time and becomes engrained in your memory as a time when everything in the world lined up perfectly to bring this one pure and perfect memory, this glorious experience that can't be tarnished over time. I love that these moments are timeless and can be shared and experienced across the ages.

In order to live in these moments and to be in a place where we can experience them, we've got to live free of the confines of regret, free from the shackles of guilt and self-doubt.

Remember that *time is the only resource in life that you will never get back*. You can always earn more money and can always buy new material things, but you'll never get your time back. It is the most valuable resource simply because it's non-renewable, and is consumed at a constant rate regardless of your wishes or whatever you do to prevent that.

And so we ought to live maximizing that resource.

That's my prayer for you - that you would live with no regrets, that you would give your all to your experiences, that you would dream without abandon, and that you would have a *rich* and full life. That the time that you spend on this world will be full of those epic moments, full of timeless, transcendent moments. And that above all things, you would love with everything that you've got.
