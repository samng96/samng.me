My son,  <p>In this life, there will be many people who try to tell you what to do, who to be, what to care about, and what to strive for. They will try to apply a value judgment to you, try to give you a framework in which to determine your own self-worth, and will try to make you fit into their molding.  <p>Don't let them.  <p>Remember that you are <em>"fearfully and wonderfully made"</em> (Psalm 139:14). God made you exactly as He wanted to, and that is a wonderful thing.  <p>That's not to say that you're perfect and don't need to strive to be better - quite the contrary! For <em>"He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus"</em> (Philippians 1:6). And what completion is that? The goal and <em>original design</em> that God had in mind for you.  <p>In that light, I urge you to figure out what that is. Decide for yourself who you ought to be, who you <em>want</em> to be, and then go and unapologetically be that person! Jesus never promised that his way would be easy, or that everyone will like you on your path, but He did promise that He <em>"[is] with you always, to the very end of the age" </em>(Matthew 28:20). You will inevitably rub some people the wrong way, you will certainly run across people who don't understand your motivations or the things that you do, and will speak out against you.  <p>Pay them no mind.  <p>Know who you were created to be, and be that. The Apostle Paul uses the term <font face="symbol">ginwskein</font>, which means "to know <em>deeply</em>". Know deeply who God wants you to be and run and follow hard after that. And know your mother and I will always love and support you, no matter who you choose to be.</p>
