My sons,

We're currently in the middle of a global pandemic. It's something that this world hasn't seen in quite some time, and is something that I sincerely pray you won't have to experience again in your lifetimes. There are many tragic stories of loss, of separated loved ones, of devastation. There are also many stories of hope, of perseverance, of strength, of unity, and of support. The impacts of this pandemic are both global and local. Globally, our economy has taken a huge hit, our social structures are stressed to the point of breaking, and our government is struggling to act decisively and swiftly. Locally, we are practicing social distancing, staying home with our families and going out only out of necessity.

It has not been an easy adjustment for many.

I recently finished a book called ["A gentleman in Moscow"](https://www.amazon.com/Gentleman-Moscow-Novel-Amor-Towles-ebook/dp/B01COJUEZ0/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2WDYESBNRMXU&dchild=1&keywords=a+gentleman+in+moscow&qid=1588310887&sprefix=a+gentl%2Caps%2C213&sr=8-1), by Amor Towles. It is a wonderful and beautifully written book that seems poignantly relevant in our current world situation. The book is a novel that follows the life of Count Alexander Rostov, a Russian aristocrat who after the revolutionary war ended in the 1920s is convicted of such. He is forced to live out his days as a "Former Person" within the confines of the Metropol hotel, not being permitted to ever leave its premises.

The book chronicles the life of the count, who first sets foot inside his new quarters in the prime of his life. He immediately has the realization that in order to survive the constant mental assault and boredom of several more decades in this space, one must have resolve, determination, and fortitude of mind. As we walk through his early days of captivity, he quickly establishes a regular routine that provides him the much needed structure of a productive life. As he settles into that routine, we watch him evolve from a person who is striving simply to *survive* to one that is longing and looking for ways to *thrive*.

It is that mental fortitude, that singular belief that in order to flourish, one must overcome one's current situation that allows the count to positively thrive for decades in such a small space.

> "Our lives are steered by uncertainties, many of which are disruptive or even daunting; but that if we persevere and remain generous of heart, we may be granted a moment of supreme lucidity - a moment in which all that has happened to us suddenly comes into focus as a necessary course of events, even as we find ourselves on the threshold of a bold new life that we had been meant to lead all along."

I certainly don't profess to know the secrets of mental fortitude, nor do I know by what magical coincidence or stroke of good luck I have been blessed with some measure of it. I do however know the secret of building fortitude, of building strength. Exercise. Just as our physical bodies require exercise and a healthy diet to build strength, our mind requires exercise and a healthy diet of positive inputs and interactions.

I've discovered a few key things that have done wonders for me:

1. Read. Reading not only develops our creativity, but it challenges our mind to imagine, to ponder, to *think deeply* about topics and situations that we may not have had the chance to face yet. It allows us to develop the ability to empathize with a character, to reason with an author, to dream wondrously with the protagonist, and to suffer deeply with the fallen hero.<br><br>
 Reading also gives us the opportunity to build relationships, dialog, and discuss with friends new and old the topics and virtues of the latest book that we've read. Read for enjoyment, read for self-development and self-improvement, read for knowledge, and read for perspective. Read fiction to dream and paint canvases in your mind. Read non-fiction to be challenged, to think critically, to ruminate, to reason.

2. Meditate. Meditation builds focus of mind, and trains our discipline. It allows us to process our thoughts, to understand ourselves, and to listen to our innermost mind.

3. Write. Writing causes you to elaborate on your thoughts, to organize them, and to provide structure to them. Regardless of whether your writings are read by three people or by three hundred, writing builds your ability to expand on a thought and to nurture and bake an idea in your mind. We all have the spark of creation within us; let it be a tool to help refine your mental process.


Jesus tells us that *"in this life, you will have trouble"*. That is a certainty. Those with an ample supply of mental fortitude are the ones who are able to not only survive, but to *thrive* in those troubles. And that's my hope for you today, that you both would be strong men, physically, emotionally, but most importantly mentally. That you would have the strength of mind and discipline of heart to achieve all that you set your sights on.
