My son,

One of the most sobering realizations that you'll have in your life is that your life this side of heaven is finite. As I noted last month, *time is the* only *resource in life that we will never get back*. Each moment that you spend is one that you're never going to get back. So how do we make the most of it? And what's that got to do with self-respect?

Quite a bit actually.

Self-respect is the thing that lets you own your own destiny, that lets you fearlessly choose the path that you want to take. You are beautifully and wonderfully made - own that. Claim it. Run with it.

There are all sorts of benefits from having a strong sense of self-respect, of self-esteem, but the fundamental thing is that it gives you confidence to be your own man, to do things that may not be popular, to stand up against opposition, and to do the things that you believe in.
