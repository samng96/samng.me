My son,

Something I realize I've taken for granted in these posts is the fact that I believe deeply that you can change your stars. Not just that you can be whatever and whomever you want to be, but that the future is unwritten, and that you can be an author in the grand drama that is ever unfolding.

One of the greatest founding principles and beliefs of many of our modern nations is that we are free. Free to believe, free to speak, free to associate, free to express, and free to be happy with the life and path that we've chosen. That freedom is the very foundation on which many, if not all, of the thoughts that I'm able to share with you are based on. I have nothing but the utmost respect and gratitude for that freedom, and for the men and women that make that freedom possible.

That very freedom is the foundation by which we are able to move life forward, are able to be a change agent, are able to thoughtfully and intentionally shape our world the way we dream of. To quote from Whitman:

> You are here - that life exists and identity,
> That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.

You may contribute a verse. You may *author* a verse. You have the power to impact that powerful play, and you can be a force that can *change the world*.

The only way to do that is to *be authentic* in your expression. Write your verse. Speak your mind. Sing your songs. Make your music. But do all of those things *authentically*. Do them with the fullness of your conviction and your beliefs. Don't take half measures. Be all in.

The world is full of people, of corporations, of agendas that want to shape you into something you're not. Don't let them. As the Lord said to Joshua,

> Be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go. ~Joshua 1:9

So my challenge to you today is to write, to sing, to dance, to paint, to create, to invent, or to do whatever it is that you do. And to do it all with all your heart and determination. The future is truly unwritten, and it is up to you how you want to write it.
