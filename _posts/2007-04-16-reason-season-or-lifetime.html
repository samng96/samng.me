It's funny how things turn out sometimes. One minute you're standing at the mountain's peak, on top of the world and ready to take on anything. And then the next, you've sunk so low and are so lost you don't know which end is up. I think... no, I <span style="font-style: italic;">believe</span> that the determining factor of how fast you fall, how high you can get, and how hard it hurts is your friendships.<br /><br />Friends and family are the supports and the cheering squad, pushing you to get to the highest height. They are the parachute that keeps you from falling too fast. They are the trampoline that helps you bounce right back up again. They are arguably the <span style="font-style: italic;">best and most fulfilling things</span> this world has to offer.<br /><br />And yet sometimes they fade. They change unexpectedly and, even worse, <span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">inexplicably</span></span>. Your closest friend one day may not remember you the next. Your worst enemy may give the toast at your wedding. Isn't it bizarre how things <span style="font-style: italic;">change</span> sometimes?<br /><br />A good friend of mine once told me that <span style="font-style: italic;">relationships can be for a reason, a season, or a lifetime</span>. Some friends are in our lives to teach us something, to help us learn a lesson, to be better. They may be there to comfort us in a time of need, or may be there to show us something we need to work on. Some friends are there for a season. Highschool, College, summer camps, vacations, classmates. And some friends are for life, ones that you'll grow old with, that you'll share all the joys and tears of life with.<br /><br />So that leaves us with the big question: <span style="font-style: italic;">How do you know which is which?</span>
