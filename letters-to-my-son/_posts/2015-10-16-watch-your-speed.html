My son,  <p>I love speed. You know this. But every so often, life needs a speed check.  <p>Don't get me wrong - speed is great. It's exhilarating. It's adrenaline-inducing. It's memory-making.  <p>But there comes a time when you need to slow down and take special care to the details that you might miss at high speeds. Here's why.  <ol> <li>Speed requires you to be looking forward always - since things come so quickly at you, you need to be focused on what's ahead to make sure you don't slam into a wall. And this is a great thing - focus enables us to do great things. It gives us purpose, gives us goals, gives us a drive to continue onward. But it also makes the things not in front of us relegated to our peripheral vision only. </li> <li>Speed requires you to act on instinct and intuition. Again, this can be a great thing - if we know the path ahead and are sure footed, this isn't a problem. But when the road becomes less clear and the path less obvious, speed gives us less time to react and adjust.</li> <li>Speed dulls your other senses, and you can get tunnel vision. </li></ol> <p>While all of those things aren't bad in themselves, life is about balance. <em>Sometimes you have to slow down in order to see clearly</em>. Sometimes, you need to take in all that's around you, examine the details, and see the hidden beauty in the things that are all around.  <p>Remember that life isn't just about having a singular goal, even though at times those may be there. Life is about more than that - it's about the journey, about the people that are with you, about the small unexpected circumstances that you may find yourself in. It's about the small shared moments of disappointment. It's about the shared experience of comfort. It's about walking together through struggles. It's about celebrating together through victories. It's about making the most out of every moment that you've got, and sometimes, <em>sometimes</em>, you need to slow down to notice those things.</p>
