My son,</p>  <p>I love being inspired.</p>  <p>One of the most inspiring things is witnessing the things man can accomplish. Watching a painter pour their soul onto their canvas, experiencing for the first time a new piece reflecting a musician's inner turmoil, reading a short story written to celebrate life's great virtues, or walking into the great architecture of the ages built as places of worship or safekeeping - all of these things inspire me to be better, to reach higher, and to aim for the stars.</p>  <p>It's a beautiful thing about life, this ability to create. We are all created beings, created in the image of God, in <em>His</em> likeness. That means we have God's spark in us, and with that spark comes the ability for us as created beings to in turn create. Now, obviously we don't have God's omnipotence, so we can't make something from nothing, but we have a glimpse of his creativity and imagination, and can in our own way create beauty where there was none before.</p>  <p>Whether itâ€™s taking a year to write your own symphony or taking an hour to paint a sunset, I believe that something within us pulses stronger when we create. It is in that moment, that space where we forget about the world, abandon its distractions, and focus solely on the object of our creation that we are elevated from the temporary into the <em>timeless</em>. We see the world from another angle; we gain a new perspective, and with new perspective comes new understanding.</p>  <p>Have you ever noticed how things of great beauty are often epic and awesome in nature? Sunsets, canyons, monuments, masterpieces, mountaintops - all of these things are vast in their being, and bring us to a place of awe and wonder.</p>  <p>I believe that the wonder we feel is the creator <em>in us </em>resonating with the creation we're experiencing.</p>  <p>And so with that, I'll leave you with a challenge. Create! Build, paint, compose, craft; express the experiences, thoughts, and dreams that are uniquely you. <em>Because you are beautifully and wonderfully made</em>. </p>
