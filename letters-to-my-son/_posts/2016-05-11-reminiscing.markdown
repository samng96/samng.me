My son,

It's human nature to reminisce, to think back to days gone by, and to romanticize the days gone by. While I certainly don't support living in the past and not being able to live in the present (that's another topic for another day), I do believe there is value on occasionally reminiscing about your past.

**Reminiscing reminds you of your values**<br>
One excellent outcome of reminiscing is that it reminds you about your values. The things that are absolutely core to your being, the things that you care about, are driven by, and are unwilling to compromise - reminiscing reminds you of those things.

One of the prerequisites of living a full life is to know what you're living for, what you're *loving* for. And the only way to know that is to *know thyself* intimately enough to know your motivators, your passions, and the values that define your very being.

The things that we reminisce about are clues to what we truly care about.

**Reminiscing shifts your mindset**<br>
One of the great things about the human mind is the ability to transcend the immediate and be immersed in something greater, something bigger than ourselves.

When we take the time to thoughtfully consider the victories and mountaintop experiences of the past, our mindset shifts to adapt. By recalling and reliving those great moments, we're able to put ourselves in that environment again, and are able to focus on how we felt, how we reacted, how we anticipated, and how we thought in that moment. We're able to adopt the mindset of our experience and apply it to our current existence, and respond accordingly.

**Reminiscing  brings your current path into focus**<br>
By remembering where we've come from and noting where we are, we're able to extrapolate the path that we're on so that we can course correct as needed. In looking back on our past experiences, we're able to see the growth that we've had since, and are able to focus on the path and see where we're headed.

So my challenge to you is not to be afraid to look at where you've been, but to deliberately do so in a manner that helps you be more confident in who you are, where you've come from, and where you're headed. Don't get stuck in the past, but rather learn from it. Draw strength from it, and use it to channel and direct your energy where you want it to go.
