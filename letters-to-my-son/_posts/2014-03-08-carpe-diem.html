<p>My son,</p>
<p>By now, I'm sure you've heard many slogans and jingles about how short life is, and may have even come to terms with that notion yourself in your experiences. I love the timeless sentiment from Robin Williams:
</p>
<blockquote><em>But if you listen real close, you can hear them whisper their legacy to you.
  Go on, lean in. Listen, you hear it? Carpe diem. Seize the day boys. Make your lives extraordinary</em>
</blockquote>
<p>I love that word he chose, "legacy". Listen to the legacy of those who have gone ahead of us. And what is that legacy? To seize the day, to make the most of the days that you have, to aim to live an extraordinary life.</p>
<p>Extraordinary, in this sense, is not a judgment of value upon the life or the series of actions that make up that life; rather, it is merely a description of those actions.
    <em>Extra</em>, meaning "outside of", the ordinary. The charge is to live a life that is different, that takes chances, that strives to be more than what society funnels us to be. Like we talked about last time,
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-02-17-be-first-rate-version-of-you %}" target="_blank"><em>
          Be a first-rate version of you</em></a>.
</p>
<p>The phrase <em>Carpe Diem </em>goes slightly further, and suggests not only to be the best <em>you</em> that you can be, but to make that <em>you </em>something unique, something unexpected, something different than the well-trodden path that the world
    tries to impose on you. Set your heart and your mind on being <em>extra-ordinary</em>.
</p>
<p>This concept of choosing your own path is really part of your namesake. <em>Maverick </em>means one that doesn't conform to society, but chooses one's own path. Romans 12:1-2 speaks also of not conforming to the patterns of this world, but being transformed
    by the renewing of your mind <em>so that </em>you can determine, test, and approve God's will for your life.</p>
<p>That, ultimately, is the prayer that your mom and I have for your life - that you will intentionally choose your path, and that it will be a God-pleasing path. Seize the day, and encourage others to do the same.</p>
