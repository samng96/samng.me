My son,

Last time, we talked about paying attention. More explicitly, I suggested that the world has a road that they want you to follow, and if you don't choose your path yourself and pay attention to where you're going, you'll naturally fall into that path.

Today I want to encourage you to follow your passions. 

How is this related? For starters, people who follow their passions whole heartedly tend to carve out a path for themselves that allow those passions to flourish. More importantly though, following your passion allows you to encounter others that do the same.

Passion is one of those things that is entirely additive in nature - the more you do life with passionate people, the more that passion rubs off on you. 

As you grow up, there will be many attempts to get you to conform, to "fall in", to focus on doing what's expected of you. By the time you read this, I hope I've helped you keep time set aside for yourself, for you to follow the things that excite you, for you to let the things that spark your soul flourish. 

As much effort and pressure the world puts on you to conform to a path, it strangely doesn't reward that conformity, which is a bit of a mystery. Those that have the patience, persistence, and gall to follow their own path are the ones that not only end up being more successful, but end up being more interesting, keeping more interesting company, and leading rich and full lives as a result.

While I'm not saying to completely buck the trend and be completely non-conformist, I am saying that you need to pay attention and invest in your passions as well. At the end of it all, *that's* what brings you the joy, fulfillment, and happiness of a life well lived.
