"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how" - Nietzsche

My son,

There's a natural tension in life between today and tomorrow. As you know, *time is the* only *resource in life that we will never get back*, and so we naturally want to maximize that. This creates the dilemma of whether we should invest in tomorrow or if we should spend on today.

As much as I would love to give you a hard and fast rule for which choice to make, the reality is that the *richest* lives are lived somewhere in the middle - investing enough in tomorrow while still spending time today to *live* your life.

So then what are we talking about today?

*Balance*.

A rich and full life is one that balances our investments in the future - school, learning, reading, developing skills and interests - with our enjoyment of today - shooting the breeze with friends, sitting on the deck and enjoying the sunset, standing in awe of the most beautiful sight you've ever seen.

Asian culture tells us to invest in tomorrow. We're taught to save our money and to invest it. We're constantly reminded to work hard *today* so that we can be successful *tomorrow*. We're reminded to think about the big picture, about the life that we want to have *later*, about our next job, our future wife and family, our retirement plans.

And yet there's no emphasis on *today*.

In that sense, *tomorrow is something that is always coming but never comes*.

And that's my challenge for you today. While investing in the future, make sure you take the time to smell the roses. *Make time* to do it. And do it *big*. Whether this means turning on your noise-cancelling headphones and cranking up your favorite epic song, sitting outside with a glass of wine and watching the sun set over the horizon, or taking a walk down a familiar street with the love of your life.

Those are the moments - those perfect, timeless moments - that give you strength to keep pushing forward. Those moments you'll remember for a lifetime, and will ultimately confirm for yourself that you're exactly where you're supposed to be.
