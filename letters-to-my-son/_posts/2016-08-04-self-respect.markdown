My son,

One of the most sobering realizations that you'll have in your life is that your life this side of heaven is finite. As I noted last month, *time is the* only *resource in life that we will never get back*. Each moment that you spend is one that you're never going to get back. So how do we make the most of it? And what's that got to do with self-respect?

Quite a bit actually. 

Self-respect is the thing that lets you own your own destiny, that lets you fearlessly choose the path that you want to take. You are beautifully and wonderfully made - own that. Claim it. Run with it. 

There are all sorts of benefits from having a strong sense of self-respect, of self-esteem, but the fundamental thing is that it gives you confidence to be your own man, to do things that may not be popular, to stand up against opposition, and to do the things that you believe in.

<ul>
<li> <b>Confidence to fight for the little guy.</b><br>
This one is arguably the most important. In this world, there are so many people without voices - the sick, the poor, the scrawny kid in class that gets picked on, the girl on the bus that no one wants to sit with. <p />

To each of these, Jesus asks us to love them as He loves us. In Matthew 25:40, Jesus tells us that <i>"whatever you did for the least of these, you did for me"</i>. <p />

In my own life, I've found that this one is extremely difficult. It's so hard to step outside the norm, to go against the grain, to put yourself out there to stand up for the little guy. But just think - how much harder is it for them? <p />
</li>
<li><b>Confidence to stand up for what you believe.</b><br>
We live in an age where the social norm is to not offend, to not have beliefs that could show disapproval to anything that popular culture deems is acceptable. We have axioms like <i>"it's the nail that sticks out that gets hammered"</i>. <p />

Never in the history of our world has there been a need for people to stand firm in what they believe in, to have a deep rooted sense of morality, and to be that light on a hill for all to see.<p />
</li>
<li><b>Confidence to be alone.</b><br>
It's tough being alone. Whether it's being circumstantial - being home alone for an evening, going to an even like prom alone, or even taking a vacation on your own - or if it's a longer term thing like being single while your friends are coupled off, being alone is tough.<p />

Having self-respect gives you the confidence and sense of self enough to be not just okay with those situations, but to stop seeing them as inflictions and instead to start seeing them as opportunities. <p />
</li>
<li><b>Confidence to strike it out on your own.</b><br>
It's a basic human instinct to seek safety, and to seek safety in numbers. Striking out on your own goes against that very nature and by definition isn't easy. <p />

But so much of life, so much about being a man, so much about an enriching experience is only accomplished and experienced when you strike out on your own. Being your own man isn't easy, but it's absolutely essential.<p />
</li>
<li><b>Confidence to ask her to marry you.</b><br>
Nothing is more nerve wracking than when you find yourself on one knee holding a little box with a ring that costs 3 months of your salary in it. Nothing. <p />

And no matter what anyone else tells you, nothing should be. <p />

Finding a life partner that you can run with, laugh with, celebrate with, and mourn with is so hard, and when you finally find her, asking her to be yours as long as you both shall live is nerve wracking. As it should be. <p />

Having confidence in yourself lets you realize that it's just as hard for her, and that it's just as big of a commitment for her as it is for you. And that's a good place to be.<p />
</li></ul>
So my prayer is that as you grow into a young man that you would have confidence in the man that God is created you to be, and that out of that understanding of self, of self-worth, of self-respect and self-esteem can come a heart for the world that is kind, considerate, protective, bold, and courageous. I love you, my boy.
