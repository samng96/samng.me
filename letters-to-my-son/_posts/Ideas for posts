- Candle power - when the wind blows it, it shines brighter
- Never ask advice of someone with whom you wouldn't want to trade places - Darren Hardy
- How can you achieve your 10 year plan in the next 6 months? - Peter Thiel
- Wherever it is you want to go, there is a long and conventional path, and there are shorter, less conventional approaches. The long conventional path is the outcome of not paying attention. It's what happens when you let other people dictate your life.

- Don't have a big life dream - they focus you only on one thing and you miss the things around you
