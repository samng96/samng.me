My son,

Throughout history, every single achievement that mankind has accomplished has been a group effort. Even the great ones - Einstein, Gretzky, da Vinci - all of them had strong influences that encouraged, challenged, instructed, and inspired them to be able to have accomplished the great things that we know them for today.

There has been much research about a person's development, growth, and ultimate success as a healthy, fully functioning member of society. While there are very drastically different theories on the most important experiences or surroundings that produce successful people, every theory agrees that relationships are critical to a person's upbringing.

As the good book says:
> "Bad company corrupts good character" - 1 Corinthians 15:33

It is therefore critically important that you be thoughtful about the company that you keep, about the relationships that you *build*. Build being the operative word here.

Make no mistake about it - relationships are works of art that need to be *intentionally built*. They need to be thought out, planned, worked on, evaluated, and refined. Whether we're talking about a casual acquaintance, a lifelong friendship, or an epic romance, each of these need to be sought after, worked on, invested in, and cared for.

So how do we build the right relationships?

While I am by no means an expert on the subject, I can share with you my thoughts and observations.

	1. Be mindful about the type of investment this is. Not all relationships are equal. Some are meant for your enrichment, some are meant for you to learn patience and endurance as you pour into someone else for their enrichment. Some are mutually beneficial. Know which is which.
	2. Own it. Be intentional about what you want out of each relationship. While it's very easy to have acquaintances and friends that are seemingly aimless, don't tolerate that. Be deliberate and thoughtful about each relationship you have.
	3. Prune it. Reclassify relationships as required, and prune the ones that no longer serve a purpose. Relationships themselves will naturally run their course, and while it is certainly easier in the immediate instance to allow them to do that without your intervention, in the long run, you'll find that being intentional here is going to be far better.
	4. Pour your life into it. For relationships that you've decided are worthwhile, go big. Don't take half-measures, but pour your all into it. Relationships are two-way streets - the more you pour into them, the more you'll get out of them.

My hope for you is that you will have a lifetime of rich experiences, and great relationships and companions to travel the road with you. Remember to go big, to dream without abandon, to give without expectation. And above all, *love with everything that you've got*.
