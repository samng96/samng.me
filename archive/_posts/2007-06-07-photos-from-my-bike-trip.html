So I recently took another bike trip with Rich and the boys from Waterloo, this time around the west coast. Here's a link to some <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/samng96/May2007BikeTrip">pictures</a>.<br /><br />I started out in Seattle, headed down though Idaho to Oregon and met up with one of the guys there. We then headed down to Utah, through a bunch of scenic, twisty mountain roads to Moab, where the Arches National Park is, and where we hooked up with Rich and the rest of the guys. From there, we went down to Arizona and Nevada, spent a night in Vegas, went through Death Valley, then went to the coast of California. We travelled up the coast through San Francisco, then up the Oregon coast, and then finally back to Seattle
