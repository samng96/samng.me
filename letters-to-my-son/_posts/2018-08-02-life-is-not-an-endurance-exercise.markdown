My sons,

There are times when life feels simply like a grind. Too much work to do, too many books to read, too much study left with topics to learn. In those times, it is easy to feel like life is an endurance exercise, that it is something to be endured.

We're told that our endurance is rewarded. We're told that studying hard in school means that we'll be rewarded with a great job. When we start that great job, we're told that working hard will allow us to advance quickly and will give us the freedom and purchasing power to enjoy the fruits of our labor. Then we have kids and we're told that we need to invest in our kids and give them every opportunity. Following this train of thought, the point at which we stop enduring and stop working incredibly hard is the day that we retire.

And then we can enjoy life.

Now, don't get me wrong - I'm not at all suggesting that working hard is a bad thing, and that perseverance and grit aren't noble characteristics; quite the opposite. I want you to grow up as steadfast men, as men that have grit and perseverance, as men that stand up for the right things and fight the good fight. But I also want you to grow up as *balanced* men, men that recognize when it's time to be running the race, but also when it's time to be having fun, enjoying life and love, creating joy, and experiencing freedom.

*Life should not only be an endurance exercise.*

Even in our physical exercise, we're told to take breaks. Just as the body needs time to rehydrate, to recover, and to refuel, so too do our souls need that time. Push hard, yes. Go big, yes. But make sure that you don't work so hard that you forget what it's like to have fun. Make sure you've got people by your side that you can have the time of your life with, who will be there to shoulder the load with you when you can't carry it alone, who will be there to jump off a cliff with you when you desire it, and who will laze by the pool with you when you need it.

My hope is that you can be that for each other, that you can help keep each other balanced. Run the race together, yes. But also celebrate the victory together. I pray there are many of those for you both. I love you boys.
