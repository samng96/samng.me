My son,

We live in a time when the amount of information that's available out there is enormous. The information age is in full swing, and we're generating data at an astronomical rate. Gartner has forecasted that the sheer volume of information that will be generated in a single year in 2020 will be four times the amount of information accumilated from the dawn of the internet to our present day. 

By 2020, we're also expected to surpass one trillion devices in the world that are connected and generating raw information for someone to consume. For a world population of 7 billion or so, that's an astronomical amount of devices.

So why am I bringing this up? Because the average person will be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the stream of noisy information that they get, and it will become critical for you to know how to turn that information into insight that you can act on.

As with everything in life that's worth doing, this takes practice. There's no substitute for raw hours put in to refine your craft and your abilities. So *practice*. Be diligent about consciously tuning out the noise and filtering out what you need to hear.

Next, know what you're looking for. Know what you need from each information stream and don't get drawn in to the distractions. Remember that much of the content that's out there is made to distract, to entertain. Isn't it strange that when something doesn't have *actual* value, we say it has *entertainment* value? 

Lastly, tell stories. Each new insight that you take in should sharpen your narrative and provide clarity to the story you're telling. Make sure it does that, and make sure you tell each updated version of your story often. 

Because at the end of the day, the most valuable thing we'll be able to add to this world's story is our own.
