My sons,

Something that's been on my mind a lot lately is the concept of *choosing* to love, especially when it's hard.

It's very easy to choose to love someone or to choose to do the loving thing when things are easy. But the true test of character is what we do when things aren't easy, when they're not ideal, when they're not living up to our expectations. How do you respond? What choices do you make? Do you choose anger? Or do you choose love?

> Anger begets more anger

So *choose love*. Choose to do the thing that you know is right, even if you don't feel like it. Choose to hold to the principles that you believed to be praiseworthy and worth pursuing when you weren't in the midst of the storm. And hold on. Tight.

How do you do it? How do you choose to do the hard thing, to do the *unnatural* thing, to do the thing that you know you ought to but really, *really* don't want to? How do you choose to hold your tongue when you're ready to rip someone a new one? How do you choose to love, to swallow your hurt and pain, and do the right thing?

There's a song that I love from a movie I watched recently that's entitled *"The next right thing"*. I love so many things about that song, musically, dramatically. But most of all, I love the message the song conveys.

> This grief has a gravity, it pulls me down<br>
> But a tiny voice whispers in my mind<br>
> "You are lost, hope is gone<br>
> But you must go on<br>
> And do the next right thing"

> Break it down to this next breath, this next step<br>
> This next choice is one that I can make<br>
> So I'll walk through this night<br>
> Stumbling blindly toward the light<br>
> And do the next right thing

There will be times when you feel like you're flattened, that you're on the floor. You'll feel like the world is against you, and you'll want to give up. I hope that in that moment, for just a moment, you'll be able to take a breath and get even the briefest hint of perspective that will allow you to choose to do the next right thing.

It's something that gets easier with each victory, and is something that should be celebrated when you succeed. Take a second for yourself to internalize that feeling when you know you've chosen the right thing, even when the walls are still crumbling. When you know that while you may not have saved the current situation, you've chosen the right thing. The thing that will let you look back and be happy at the men that you've become, that despite all odds and worldly wisdom or reason that told you to choose otherwise, you chose the next right thing.

And that's my hope for the two of you; that when life goes sideways, when things *really* suck, that you'll be able to *choose* to do the next right thing.
