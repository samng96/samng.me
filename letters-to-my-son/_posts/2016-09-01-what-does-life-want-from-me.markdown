My son,

The last twenty years has seen a trend of people who are raised to believe in self, in the individual human spirit. While I'm not against the belief that intrinsically each person has value and that God created each one of us uniquely and wonderfully, I do think that we could take a lesson from one of the greats in history. 

JFK said once that we ought to **"ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country"**.

The sentiment here is that there's something greater than ourselves that we ought to consider, and that there's something to be gained, some purpose fulfilled, some satisfaction in pursuing a goal that may not have originated with us. 

Much of my generation has struggled with the question of purpose. Many spend years trying to "discover themselves", to find meaning in the chaos that is life. Conventional wisdom these days says to look within oneself for the answers, and while there is some element of truth there and we can indeed learn more about ourselves as we become more introspective, I think that's only half the story.

If we consider the things that resonate most with the human spirit, the things that kindle a fire deep within us, the things that elevate us to greater heights, to greater awareness, and to a greater richness of life - these things are not exclusively internal. The purity of the human spirit is the work of God refined by our relationships, experiences, endeavors, and shared ventures. Mankind was not put on this earth to be alone. Nor was he put on this earth to live for himself alone. 

Discovering that which we were created for, that which we are destined for - that is something that takes a lifetime to learn and to refine. As Nietzsche put it, **"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how"**. 

The vital question then becomes this: **"What does life want from me?"**. 

In other words, what is the larger, grander venture that I **ought** to be a part of?

My challenge to you is to discover what that is. And whether it is being a comfort for the weary, being a safe place for the oppressed, feeding the hungry, loving the downtrodden - no matter what it is, I urge you to run at it with all that you have. We keep talking about a deep sense of richness and fulfillment in life - this is one of the keys that will help get us there.
