My son,<p> This world often measures us by our results, by our accomplishments,
  and by the amount of impact that we've had based on our finished products.
  While results are important, they pale in comparison to the journey that we take to get there.
  <p> It is the process of refinement, of improvement, of becoming and not being that is of utmost importance.<p> For we know that character is not innate or automatic. Rather, it needs to be built, refined, tried, tested, and improved upon. It is worked on with great effort, with great intention, and with great patience. And it is not easily built alone.<p> The more we are able to find others to walk life with us, to challenge us, and to encourage us on that journey, the greater our chances of success. The more that we find ourselves in an environment that praises not our talent but our growth and our learning, the more we are able to improve and to better ourselves, <i>and in so doing</i> are better able to produce those results that our society so covets. <p> As you know, I love the epic, the inspiring, the mountaintop experiences that give you a breath of life so exhilarating that words can only describe but a glimpse of the experience. Those are the experiences from which we take away our life's greatest learnings. As David Brooks says in his book, The Road to Character: <p> <i>"Moral improvement occurs most reliably when the heart is warmed, when we come into contact with people we admire and love and we consciously and unconsciously bend our lives to mimic theirs."</i><p> I love that sentiment, that from these people that we admire and love, we <i>bend our lives</i> to mimic theirs. <p> And so to that end my challenge to you is to make sure you've surrounded yourself with people who encourage you to become more than you are, that challenge you to dig deep and to work on yourself, and that share the belief that to be is not nearly as important as to become.
