My son, <p>Jesus says that <em>"you will have suffering in this world"</em> (John 16:33 NIV). It is a certainty, and as much as I would lay down my life to keep it all from you, I can't. You too will know suffering just as Jesus did, just as we all do. The true test of a man's character, then, is how he deals with that suffering, how he responds to it, how he chooses to live his life <em>in spite</em> of it. <p>As you already know, I love the epic. I love the pursuit of greatness, the passion for the human spirit, the desire to <em>"have life, and have it to the full"</em> (John 10:10). In light of this suffering, my charge to you is to <em>love recklessly</em> as a response.  <p>By the time you are old enough to read and understand this, I hope that U2 is still around and you'll know have heard the song <em>Pride</em>, which puts it in such a beautiful way: <blockquote> <p><em>"In the name of love! What more in the name of love?"</em> </p></blockquote> <p><em>Pride</em> pays a tribute to the life and work of Dr. Martin Luther King (the last verse sings of April 4th in the Memphis sky, which was the date and location that Dr. King was assassinated), and is a response to the legacy and example that he lived. Despite the assassination, the song writer poses the question, <em>"what more in the name of love?"</em> What more can we do, in the name of love? How can we follow this example, in the name of love? <p>When we love recklessly and focus on seeing, believing, and fighting for the good in people, it doesn't only change our world; it changes us too. When our response to conflict and tribulation is to ask what more we can do in the name of love, we change our perspective. To be reckless means to choose to take an action, <em>despite</em> rational thought telling us otherwise. The more we choose to be reckless, the more our rational thought adjusts to compensate. This in turn removes the inhibitions of what we believe is possible, allowing us to think of the world not as it is, but as it ought to be - and <em>that</em> is certainly a good thing. <p>And so my prayer for you is that you respond to the obstacles in your life not with frustration, anger, or disappointment, but with a response that throws reason out the window, and <em>just loves.</em></p>
