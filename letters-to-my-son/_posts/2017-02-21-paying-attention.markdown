My son,

As you know by now, I try to be a pretty intentional person. I heard something the other day that I absolutely loved, so I thought I'd share it with you.

> Wherever it is you want to go, there is a long and conventional path, and there are shorter, less conventional approaches. The long conventional path is the outcome of not paying attention. It's what happens when you let other people dictate your life.

I've found this to be extremely true in my experiences. 

While I do believe it is sometimes beneficial to not pay attention, those times should be explicitly decided upon. Some of the best memories I've had were days where a few of us had no firm plans or designs, but rather played the day by ear and presently discovered that we had a fabulous time as a result. Those are days that are intentionally unintentional, and aren't the subject of my attention today.

What I'm referring to today is the consciousness and critical nature that is required at a grander scale. It is more than just ability; it is a trained state of mind, a refined attribute that may take years of intentional practice to adequately acquire. 

It is the art of knowing what pieces of input to process and come back to, and what to discard and not spend time on. It is the discipline to remember to step back and look at the bigger picture ervery so often. It is having the audacity to challenge the norms that are given to you, that you're supposed to just accept.

The truth is that society doesn't want you to do that. It wants to raise a geeration of people that are easily influenced by the latest greatest marketing trends that are out there. Capitalism is selfish by nature, and so it will do everything in its power to numb your senses and have you follow the path that profits it the most.

My challenge to you today is to make sure you're paying enough attention to be able to intentionally choose which path you take. Because even if there are many paths to your destination, time is the resource that you'll never get back. So make the most of your time and pay attention to what you're doing, where you're going, and who you're going there with!
