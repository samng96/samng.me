My son,


- Be critical of your own opinions and beliefs

Today, you turn four. What a joy you are! You are such a beautiful, wonderful, kind, adventurous, and mischievous little guy - I love you so much! Your mom calls you my little buddy cause we do all sorts of things together. I couldn't be happier. Much of what I've been learning these days I'm learning from you and with you, and I love the thought that I get to share those learnings with you here with the hopes that someday when you're older, you'll read them and they'll be learnings for you as well.

When I was growing up, I read many different articles and perspectives around what love is. Love is a feeling. Love is a commitment. Love is a choice. Love is easy. Love is hard. Love is patient. Love is a million different things, depending on who you ask and what perspective you're coming from.

While I don't pretend to be any expert on the matter, and while I won't attempt to give a full definition of what love is, I believe that one of the things that defines people who love *strongly* is that they *choose* to love. Regardless of your definition of love, regardless of how you experience it and what it means to you, I firmly believe that very often, love is a choice.

It's easy to love someone when everything is going very well. It's easy to love someone that's very lovely, loves you back, is in sync with you and your thoughts and perspectives. It's hard to love someone that is doing things to make themselves less lovable to you. It's hard to love someone when they're at odds with you, when they're attacking you, when they're in violent opposition to things that are at the core of your being and values.

And yet I urge you to *choose love*.

Whether we're talking about an unlovable neighbor, a combative classmate, a family member currently at odds with you, or even a spouse that you've got a strong disagreement with; *choose love*. It's hard. It takes self sacrifice and patience. It requires you to grit your teeth and not fight back. It means you have to take punches without throwing up your guard and without counter attacking.

*But it will be worth it.*

My prayer for you is that you are able to choose love more often than the alternatives, and that you grow to become a man that is characterized by his heart for people. We have always prayed that you be a kind person; I would urge you to go one step further and be someone that chooses to love when everyone else disagrees. Because love conquers all things. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
