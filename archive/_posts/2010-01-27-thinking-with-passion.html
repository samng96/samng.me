<p>I attended a lecture recently about revolutionary thinking, and the lecturer recited a very insightful quote from the great Albert Einstein: “There are two ways to live life. One is to live as though <em>nothing</em> is a miracle. The other is to live as though <em>everything</em> is a miracle.”</p>  <p>That really got me thinking about my own life, and the series of random events and acts that seem to comprise it. I’ve gotten too complacent in my thought life, and I think its time to start up again. Life is <em>not</em> a series of random events. It is a series of events whose purpose and common thread may be teased out by careful reflection and meditation. It is that reflection that helps elevate one’s mind from being situated in the realm of the conscious to that of the unconscious – that uninhibited subconscious thought, free of the boundaries and limitations placed upon us by our surroundings. </p>  <p>And so it’s with that thought in mind that I’m kickin’ myself back in gear, and starting up this blog (which I’ve re-branded!) again. So whatever you do, think, and think with <em>passion</em>!</p>
