My sons,

It's easy to look at the world around us and see its many flaws and many weaknesses. It's easy to see the hatred, the racism, the sexism, the anger, the suspicion - it's easy to look at all that and decide to keep your head down and mind your own business.

And no one would fault you for that.

We live in a world where people are *expected* to cower, to keep their voices down, and to do the bare minimum to appease their own consciences, often with little to no impact.

I implore you to choose a different path.

I recently read a beautiful speech from the 26th president of these United States, Theodore Roosevelt, which has since come to be known as *The Man in the Arena*. It reads:

> It is not the critic who counts; <br>
> not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, <br>
> or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. <br><br>
> The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,<br>
> whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;<br>
> who strives valiantly; who errs,<br>
> who comes short again and again,<br><br>
> because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;<br>
> but who does actually strive to do the deeds;<br>
> who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions;<br>
> who spends himself in a worthy cause;<br><br>
> who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,<br>
> and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while *daring greatly*,<br>
> so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls<br>
> who neither know victory nor defeat.<br>

Yes, there are many ways in which we have fallen. Yes, there are many unspeakable acts and unimaginable crimes that have been committed, and even sanctioned in our lifetimes. Yes, we are surrounded by imperfection in this fallen world.

But let us stop standing on the sidelines watching idly as others struggle and fight in our stead. Let us never stop picking ourselves back up and getting back into the arena. Let us fight for those who cannot fight for themselves. Let us speak up for the voiceless. Let us defend the defenseless. Let us bring hope to the hopeless.

Let us let shine the nobility of the human spirit; that spark within us that when pressed enables us to stand courageous with a courage we didn't know existed.

I love you, my boys. I pray that when you are old enough to understand these words, that you will find your father in the arena, that he will be standing side by side and back to back with men and women that he loves and loves him, and - most of all - that you will join them in the arena and fight together.
