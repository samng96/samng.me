My son,

As much as I wish I did, the truth of the matter is that I don't have all the answers. Nor am I always right. My thoughts in these letters to you are just that; my thoughts. These letters are a culmination of my experiences, my influences, my environment, and my best efforts. But they are just mine.

The reality is that you are your own person, with your own interests, your own designs, your own desires, your own aspirations. If you're anything like you are at the time of my writing this, then you'll have so many of these things. Even at this young age, you've got a beautiful personality, decisive, confident, and full of passion. My prayer is that over the years, all of those have grown and have molded and shaped you into a wonderful man.

So with that in mind, today's thought is going to be pretty simple.

> "Find something to care about; and then care deeply about it."

And that's it. No matter what you do with your life, no matter pursuits you choose for yourself, pursue them strongly and deeply. Your mother and I will love you and support you regardless of what you choose. My charge to you today is that *whatever and whomever* you choose to care about, care *deeply*. 

I love you, my boy. I can't wait to see what kind of man you choose to be.
