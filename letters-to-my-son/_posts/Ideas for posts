- How can you achieve your 10 year plan in the next 6 months? - Peter Thiel
- A great leader seeks to understand more than they instruct, debate more than they direct, push people to decide rather than decide themselves, pursuade rather than give orders.
- Being a leader is a role or a job, not a value judgment!

- Dignity is the mastery of the external whereas redemption is the mastery of the internal.

- Composure
- Nonviolent communication
- Ubiquitous connectivity of the future

- Trust boils down to four things - integrity, intent, capability, results.
- What are you willing to risk to get what you want?

- Mythos, CS Lewis
- Leading is not when you want to fight something. It's when you say you can beat it instead of fighting it. (?)

- Be defined by being someone that is FOR other people, not yourself.
  - Never too late to start - may have been rocky soil at the start, but can work the soil to make it more fruitful

- And yet we also live in a time of the 10 second sound byte, the 50 word tweet, the 2 minute read, and the TL;DR. So much information is flooding our senses in an attempt to capture the most valuable currency the internet has to offer; our eyeballs. Our attention. Our views. Our likes.
- The quest for nobility of character seems like itâ€™s no longer there, and has been replaced by the quest for what? Instagram fame? Success? Career advancement?
