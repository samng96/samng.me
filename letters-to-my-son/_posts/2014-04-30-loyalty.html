<p>My son, <p>They say that you can tell the caliber of a man by the company that he chooses to keep. I would take that one step further and say that you can also tell the strength of a man by the type of company that he <em>is</em>.  <p>By now, you'll have met many different types of people, all with unique characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. By now, you'll have also decided which of these people you want to keep as company, who you'll want by your side as you conquer life's struggles. With each mountain you climb, with each struggle you overcome together, you'll not only learn more about the man that you are, but you'll discover as I have, that loyalty can't be bought; it must be earned, built, <em>refined</em>.  <p>Above all other things, it ensures that no matter what life throws at you, you will not be alone, that you will have people to overcome those situations with you. Loyalty says that no matter what happens, no matter what new bad discovery or situation, come hell or high water, I will be by your side.  <p>Loyalty is a two way street, built together from both sides. Earned, not bought. Just as you must earn the loyalty of your friends, your loyalty too must be earned. Don't give it away freely or easily, but roll up your sleeves, get into the grit of life, and build it.  <p>Adlai Stevenson writes: <blockquote> <p><em>"The dedication of a lifetime â€” these are words that are easy to utter, but this is a mighty assignment. For it is often easier to fight for principles than to live up to them."</em></p></blockquote> <p>Loyalty. Faithfulness. Dedication. Devotion.  <p>I urge you to think about these things, to consider the traits that you wish to develop in yourself, and to choose wisely what kind of man you want to be. </p>
