My sons,

Hopefully by the time you both read this, I'll still be as avid a reader as I am while I'm writing (or perhaps even moreso!). Over the past few years, I've been trying to read books that are outside the standard set of things that I have spent much of my life concerned about. Books that don't have to do with leadership, technology, faith, or self-improvement. Books that are works of fiction. Books that are on topics I've spent less minutes thinking about than I've got fingers.

A great friend recommended one to me, called ["When Breath becomes Air"](https://www.amazon.com/When-Breath-Becomes-Paul-Kalanithi/dp/081298840X/). It's a beautiful memoir by a brilliant young doctor as he struggles for meaning knowing that he's terminal and that he hasn't got a lot of time left. As I journeyed with the author through his struggle and through his quest for meaning, I found myself relating, empathizing, and searching for those same answers. Instead of an informative last testament of a man I'd never met I found a mirror held up to my own question of meaning.

And I cried. I cried for him, for his family, for his wife and daughter that survive him. I cried deeply as his wife's Epilogue ran across the pages, speaking of his focus for life and his love of relationship. It was that book that started me on my journey to better understand myself, my purpose, my meaning.

I won't say that I've found all the answers since then, and I don't doubt that when you boys read this, I will still not have all the answers. But I will say that along the way, I've been learning more and more that connection - *meaningful* connection - matters.

We were made for connection, made for relationship. We were made to *do life together*.

I've found that to be true. When I look back on the time lapse of my life so far, when I see the fleeting three-second clips of deeply cherished memories, I see connection. In every single one of those memories I see connection. Whether it is sharing a beautiful sunrise with a great college friend after pulling an all nighter together, or chatting with the one friend that stayed awake while the others slept in the back on a long cross-country drive, or even celebrating our childhood sports victories over milkshakes. Most of these moments were about connection.

It's not an accident that every success, every victory, every win that I have I immediately want someone to share it with.

It's also not an accident that the deepest, sorrowful moments of my life were all moments that I felt alone and abandoned.

We were made for connection.

So my challenge to you then, is to be generous in your attempt for connection. Put yourself out there. Be *courageous*. Be willing to make the first move, to initiate a conversation, to sit next to a stranger on a plane and not immediately put in headphones or pick up a book. Even small connections matter. A smile, making eye contact with a stranger, a friendly wave, a warm hug goodbye. You never know just how much those moments may shape someone's day.
